phonenumbers Python Library

This is a Python port of libphonenumber, originally from:
  http://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/.

Original Java code is Copyright (C) 2009-2011 Google Inc.

 - The python/ directory holds the Python code.
 - The resources/ directory is a copy of the resources/
   directory from libphonenumber.  This is not needed
   to run the Python code, but is needed when upstream
   changes to the master XML metadata need to be 
   incorporated.
