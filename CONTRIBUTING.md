Contributing to python-phonenumbers
===================================

Contributions are welcome, but please be aware that the project is directly
derived from the upstream
[upstream Java project](https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/).

As a result, any changes to the phonenumber metadata or to the API should be
[submitted there](https://code.google.com/p/libphonenumber/issues/entry) rather
than here; only issues or contributions that are specific to the Python version
are likely to be relevant here.
